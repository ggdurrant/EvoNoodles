# EvoNoodles
This is a natural selection simulation which looks at how creatures, known as noodles, evolve their attributes in a competitive environment as they compete for resources. 

## Noodles
Noodles are simple, (mainly) vegetarian creatures which search for food in their nearby enviornment. They attempt to find food at all times to replenish their health, with the goal of reproducing. 
They have a chance at reproducing after a certain number of timesteps, where they produce a genetically similar offspring that potentially has a mutation in their DNA to differ in a trait from their parent. 
The attributes of all noodles include:
 - Size
 - Speed
 - Range
 - Vision
 - Reproduction Rate
